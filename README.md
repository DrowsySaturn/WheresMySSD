# Where'd My SSD Go?
I came up with the idea for this program after I got my new computer with a 128 GB main drive. I made it and uploaded it here because I thought it might be helpful to someone else.

## Requirements
Windows operating system (More coming later)  
.NET framework for VC 2017 [Download](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
